# NeoPixelTrinket
Small toy made of a NeoPixel ring and an Arduino Trinket

See the Arduino file for a detailed description of this project.  It's basically a small weirdly-shaped flashlight.

This project requires the Adafruit NeoPixel library.  If you don't know what NeoPixels are or where to find their library, you should read (Adafruit's Guide to NeoPixels)[https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide].
